List: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFv55TajSAg&list=PLUtkqA7NXVH7ctoJYhsh4xqJn3iWMpP30

### After basic stuff, should start to watch fun parts.

### Goals:
* Learn HTML, CSS, JS
* Learn A-Frame for WebVR, maybe AR later on.
* Possibly find out how Headset can be used more.
* Learn geometry and math.
* Learn vue.js to allow parameters driven by UI.
* Use github to manage.

### A-Frame First Steps: Boilerplate basic scene
* [x] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFv55TajSAg 
  * [x] Setup folder for Eric's project.
  * [x] Used live-server to refresh page automatically.
  * [x] Followed the example used in the video, the same as a-frame.io's example.
  * [x] Explained why and how a-frame makes those tags work on a html page.
  * [x] Showed how to type with snippets.
* [ ] To upload to real server
* [ ] To use github to allow project being synced on my pc and Eric's.

### A-Frame Tutorial: Creating a scene and adding text
* [x] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHWO-nWWe5w
  * [x] Added text.
  * [x] Understand position coordinates and other parameters.

```HTML
                         <!-- e02.html -->
<!-- tag typo -->  
  <a-torus position="0 1.25 -5" radius="2" color="hotpink" shadow></a-box> 

<!-- text need to stay behind banner -->
  <a-text value="Hello, Eric!" position="-0.8 1.7 -2.9"  width="6" color="black"></a-text>
```

### A-Frame Animation Tutorial
* [x] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDAdQV4YWRc&index=3&list=PLUtkqA7NXVH7ctoJYhsh4xqJn3iWMpP30
  * [x] Followed the animation example for rotation, direction, and color animation for both Sophie and Eric.
  * [x] Sophie started to show interest a bit. She asked: is programming required to do animation? She actively typed, copy+paste, and changed attributes to see effects. I went through the example to her first, but not all examples. Then for Eric, I showed all 3 types of animations. When Sophie came back, she saw the screen and the differences right away, and asked why I did not show her those.
  * [x] Asked Eric to play with code himself. So far, not so passionate yet.

    * [x] Understand rotation about x, y, z.
    * [x] easing="linear" makes rotation at constant speed.
    * [x] introduced comments in HTML
    * [x] introduced formating of long lines by splitting per attributes.
